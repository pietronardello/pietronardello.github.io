            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Pietro Nardello. I was born in Thiene and currently live in Marostica (VI). I am a student at ITIS Fermi in Bassano del Grappa, in IT course. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to acquire various skills, both technical and social.</p>
